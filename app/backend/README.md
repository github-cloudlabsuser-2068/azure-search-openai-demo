# Backend Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the backend architecture of the application. It explains the purpose of each module or component and provides instructions on how to set up and run the backend.

## Architecture

The backend of the application follows a microservices architecture, consisting of the following components:

1. **Authentication Service**: Responsible for user authentication and authorization.
2. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
3. **User Service**: Handles user-related operations such as user profile management and user data retrieval.
4. **Data Service**: Manages the application's data storage and retrieval operations.
5. **Email Service**: Handles email notifications and communication with users.

## Setup

To set up and run the backend of the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the environment variables by creating a `.env` file and providing the necessary values.
4. Start the backend server: `npm start`

## API Documentation

For detailed information about the backend API endpoints and their usage, refer to the [API Documentation](/docs/api.md).
